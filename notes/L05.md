# Lecture 5 Basic JavaScript & DOM
- JavaScript Context
- JavaScript as a Language
- JavaScript with Web Browser

## JavaScript on Client-Side
- All web browsers support JavaScript, which is differet from desktop apps.
- Another option except JS: transcompiler / transpiler
    - translates other langs to JS
    - e.g., TypeScript (used by Google Angular)
    - TS is strongly typed JS
    - typing information is important for large scale program
    - TS cannot run on browsers
    - other langs: Dart, CoffeeScript (different syntax from JS)
- Another option: WebAssembly (similar to assembly language which is faster)
- Another option: asm.js, subset of JS but more efficient, but some browsers (like Safari) do not support it
- Other tools running on top of JS (library or framework): JQuery, React, Angular, Vue
    - JQuery has a bunch of useful tools for applications
    - interact with JS in defined ways
    - need about 6 months to understand how a framework works
    - specific framework matches websites of specific purposes
- JavaScript outside Client-Side:
    - Node.js: server running in JS but also has other usages
    - develops stand-alone apps similar to web apps
    - Electron: framework to develop stand-alone apps in JS (e.g., VS Code): combines Node.js with HTML/CSS

## JavaScript History
- JS does not support modules well
- Syntax based on C but typing like Python
- Original name for JS is LiveScript
- Have hardly relationship with Java
- ECMAScript: JS standard, has version updated every year

## JavaScript Programming
- Syntax based on C, e.g., `{}`, `++`, `--`, `//`, `/**/`
- JS is a language hard to understand and debug, e.g.,
    - missing some parameters or having extra parameters when calling a function is legal
    - function can return different types (or nothing) under different situations
    - variables can be referred before declaration (makes typo hard to debug)
    - debug environment is not great
- Helpful solutions:
    - put `"use strict";` at the beginning, which can prevent reference before declaration
    - run lint program (JSLint) to double check if there are legal but weird expressions
- JS has no strong typing: variables, parameters, functions do not have types, possible declarations:
    - `int x;`
    - `var x;`
    - `let x;`
- Special values:
    - `NaN`: not a number, result of illegal math operations, e.g., divide a string by a number
    - `undefined`: unitialized declared variables, parameters not passed values to when calling a function
    - `null`: very similar to `undefined`
- Scoping: two scopes (global and function)
    - all variables within a function are scoped to the entire function, e.g., `y` can be referred outside the for loop:
        ```js
        function example() {
            for (var x = 0; x < 12; x++) {
                var y = 15;
            }
            console.log(y);
        }
        ```
    - using `let` instead of `var` can scope `y` locally, there will be reference error:
        ```js
        function example() {
            for (let x = 0; x < 12; x++) {
                let y = 15;
            }
            console.log(y);
        }
        ```
- Arrays are dynamic and sparse
- Numeric operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- Boolean values and operators: `true`, `false`, `||`, `&&`, `!`
- Comparison operators: 
    - `==`, `!=`: apply type conversion before comparison, rules are complex
    - `===`, `!==`: compare directly, i.e., not equal if types are different, recommended
- Strings in JS 
    - can be constructed by either `''` or `""`, JS does not have separate type for characters
    - can be constructed as template literals by ``` `` ```, which can support multiple lines and variable inserts:
        ```js
        var student = "Molly";
        `Welcome to Stanfod
        ${student}
        I hope you're having fun`
        ```
- Name convention in JS is CamelCase, e.g., `stanfordComputerScience`
- Control structures: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `continue`, `break`

# JavaScript Code Examples
- Funtion structure (no types anywhere):
    ```js
    function <functionName>(<parameter0>, <parameter1>, ...) {
        return ...;
    }
    ```
- Function example:
    ```js
    "use strict";
    function power(base,exponent) {
        var result = 1;
        for (var i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
            result = result * base;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```
- NOTE: `var` is function scoping, while `let` is block scoping
- Array literal and indexing:
    ```js
    var <arrayName> = [<elem0>, <elem1>, ...];
    var <variableName> = <arrayName>[0];
    ```
- JS objects are similar to maps, where keys are not quoted:
    ```js
    var <objectName> = {<key0>: <value0>, <key1>: <value1>};
    var <valueName> = <objectName>.<key0>;
    ```
- Example for combination of functions, arrays and JS objects:
    ```js
    var locationArray =[{zipcode: "94025", location: "1234 ABC Street"},
                        {zipcode: "94301", location: "333 D Street"},
                        {zipcode: "94304", location: "1 E Street"},
                        {zipcode: "94305", location: "9 F Ave"}];
    function findLocation(zipcode) {
        for (var i = 0; i < locationArray.length; i++) {
            if (locationArray[i].zipcode == zipcode) {
            return locationArray[i].location;
            }
        }
        return "Not Found";
    }
    ```
- MongoDB (DB system) is based on JS object notation

## JavaScript in Web APP
- JS codes can be literally put inside `<script>` elem, and will be executed when open the HTML
- `<script>` can be put inside `<head>` or `<body>`
- Example of handle events (actions when a input button is clicked):
    ```html
    <input type="button" value="Say Hello" id="helloBtn" />
    <script>
    function handler() {
        alert('Hello Everyone');
    }       
    document.getElementById("helloBtn").addEventListener( // specify the elem by id
        "click", // specify the event, limited by elem type
        handler // specify the handler, which will be a function name
    );
    </script>
    ```
- Functions can be written as arrow functions, compact:
    ```html
    <script>
        document.getElementById("helloBtn").addEventListener(
            "click",
            () => alert('Hello Everyone') // anonymous compact function in one line
        );
    </script>
    ```
- Handler codes can be also literal assigned to the `onclick` attribute, but may be dangerous:
    ```html
    <input type="button" value="Say Hello" onclick="alert('Hello Everyone');" />
    ```

## Document Object Model (DOM)
- Every elem on the loaded webpage has a JS object associated with it
- Modifying these objects will interactively modify the corresponding elems on the webpage
- Document objects are accessed by `document`
    - `document` is created after the webpage is loaded
    - `document.title` is the title of the HTML, can be updated
- NOTE: web browsers can serve as an environment to run JS codes, but it is hard to debug on it
- `Document` is an object type, `document` is a variable
- `<script>` in HTML:
    - `<script>` naively put in the `<head>` will not know the objects associated with elems in `<body>`
    - `<script>` is usually put at the end of `<body>`
    - can refer to an external JS file instead of literally putting codes inside `<script>`, syntax different from external CSS:
        ```html
        <script src="document.js"></script>
        ```
    - external JS file can be put in the `<head>` effectively by deferring execution:
        ```html
        <script src="document.js" defer></script>
        ```

## DOM of Forms and Inputs
- Objects of input elems can be read by script, modifications to these objects will be rendered to elems
- Modifications can be defined in handler functions, and get processed when some events happen
- Attributes of an elem are fully corresponded with attributes of the associated JS object
    - objects of `<input type="text">` have an attribute `value` which is the literal text shown in the input box
    - when reading `value` of `<input type="text">` object, have better explictly parse it to numeric form to validate it:
        ```js
        var celsius = parseFloat(celsiusElement.value);
        ```
- When we have a `<form>` object, we can access its children elems by their `name` attribute (but not `id` attribute):
    ```html
    form id="convertForm">
    <fieldset id="convert">
    <legend>Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion</legend>
    <div><label for="celsius">Celsius:</label>
        <input type="text" id="celsius" name="celsius" /></div> <!-- specify input name attribute -->
    <div><label for="fahrenheit">Fahrenheit:</label>
        <input type="text" id="fahrenheit" name="fahrenheit" /></div> <!-- specify input name attribute -->
    <div><span class="submitspace">&nbsp;</span>
        <input type="button" value="Convert" onclick="cToF();" /></div>
    </fieldset>
    </form>
    ```
    ```js
    function cToF() {
        formElement = document.getElementById("convertForm");
        celsius = parseFloat(formElement.celsius.value); // access input elem by its name
        fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32;
        formElement.fahrenheit.value = fahrenheit; // access input elem by its name
    }
    ```
- Checkboxes:
    - key attribute of `<input type="checkbox">` object is `checked`, boolean variable
- Radio botton groups:
    - group of `<input type="radio>` have the same `name`, DOM will access the only checked one for `<form>` object by `name`
    - traditional DOM cannot directly access `value` by `name`, since it might not be able to narrow down the target object
- Pulldown menus:
    - information of `<select>` object is mainly `value` attribute, which is the `value` of the currently selected option
    - `selectedIndex` attribute of `<select>` can also be useful, which is the index of currently selected option (0-indexed)
