## JavaScript as a Functional Language
- Function declarations have 3 general ways:
    - traditional
        ```js
        function example() {
            console.log("example");
        }
        ```
    - function literal
        ```js
        var example = function () {
            console.log("example");
        } 
        ```
    - arrow function
        ```js
        var example = () => {
            console.log("example");
        }
        ```
- JS functions are objects, and they can be created by a function object constructor, where the last parameter is the body string, and the others are parameters of the defined function (not expected to use)
    ```js
    var printInfo = new Function("console.log('example')"); // note the switched quotes here
    var power = new Function("base", "exp",
        `   var result = 1;
            for (var i = 0; i < exp; i++) {
                result = result * base;
            }
            return result;
        `
    );
    ```
- Traditional function declaration hoists the function, we can use it before the declaration appears, actually function definition is hoisted to the top
    ```js
    example();
    function example() {
        console.log("example");
    }
    ```
- Other declarations (function literal, arrow function)will not be hoisted, and thus we cannot use a function before it is declared by them
- Concept of functional programming languages are not strictly defined, people might refer to functional programming languages in different contexts
- Pure Functions are functions that have no side effects, and they will always return the same results for the same inputs
    - pure functions cannot change the variable outside the function body
        ```js
        var current = 0;
        function increment() { // not a pure function
            current = current + 1;
            return current;
        }
        var name;
        function setName(newName) { // not a pure function
            name = newName;
        }
        ```
    - printing something is also a side effect
        ```js
        function outputInfo(info) { // not a pure function
            console.log(info);
        }
        ```
    - pure functions can be called in any order, which will give the same result and do not affect each other
    - but pure functions will definitely limit what we can do
- JS is not a pure functional language, having variables, states, etc
- But JS is considered as a functional language, since JS functions are first-class objects
    - regardless of how defined, functions are objects
    - functions can be passed as a parameter to other functions
        ```js
        function execute(fn, a, b) {
            var result = fn(a, b);
            console.log(result);
        }
        function add(x, y) {
            return x + y;
        }
        execute(add, 2, 3);
        execute(function(x,y) {return x - y}, 2, 3);
        execute((x,y)=> x * y, 2, 3);
        ```
    - functions can be assigned to variables
        ```js
        function multiply(a, b) {
            return a * b;
        }
        var product = multiply;
        product(2, 3);
        ```
    - functions can be assigned as properties of objects
        ```js
        function square(x) {
            return x * x;
        }
        var obj = {
            sq: square,
            cb: (x) => x * x * x
        }
        obj.sq(3);
        obj.cb(3);
        ```
    - functions can also be returned from other functions
        ```js
        function sign(x) {
            if (x >= 0) {
                return () => {console.log("positive")};
            } else {
                return () => {console.log("negative")};
            }
        }
        var resultFn = sign(2);
        resultFn();
        ```
- Some useful methods can be arised by arrays which take functions as parameters
    - `map()` calls a function on all items of an array and form a new array from the results
        ```js
        var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        var squares = numbers.map((x) => x * x);
        ```
    - `reduce()` calls a function on each elem of an array, which will take two parameters (an accumulated value and the current item), the accumulated value will be initialized as the first elem on the array, and thus the function is called length - 1 times
        ```js
        var total = number.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item); // 15
        ```
    - the accumulated value in `reduce()` can also be initialized seperately, by passing in another parameter to `reduce()`, in this case the function is called length times
        ```js
        var differentTotal = numbers.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item, 10); // 25
        ```
    - `filter()` calls a function which returns `true` or `false` for each elem of an array, and it will form a new array of elems for which the given function returns `true`
        ```js
        var mixedNumbers = [-5, 3, -12, 17, 25, -1];
        var negativeNumbers = mixedNumbers.filter((item) => item < 0);
        ```
    - note that these functions only work on real arrays, not array-like objects
- JS can call functions with not the same number of parameters as declared
    - a function can be called with fewer or more parameters than expected, and these are legal
        ```js
        function example(a, b) {
            console.log("example");
        }
        example(1);
        example();
        example(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        ```
    - `undefined` arguments can be handled, `arguments` variable within a function can access array-like list of arguments passed in, but it is not available for arrow functions
        ```js
        function varParams(a, b) {
            if (a == undefined) {
                console.log("a is undefined");
            }
            if (b == undefined) {
                console.log("b is undefined");
            }
            if (arguments.length > 2) {
                console.log("got extra arguments");
            }
        }
        ```
    - we can define default values for parameters that are not provided when declaring a function
        ```js
        function exampleDef(a = 5, b = 10, c = 15) {
            console.log(`a=${a}, b=${b}, c=${c}`);
        }
        exampleDef(); // "a=5, b=10, c=15"
        exampleDef(12, 15); // "a=12, b=15, c=15"
        exampleDef(undefined, 100, 200); // "a=5, b=100, c=200"
        ```
    - `...` can be used to get additional parameters, which are referred to as rest parameters, and by convention the parameter used to store them in is named `rest`, `rest` has a real array with the additional values in it, which can gracefully handle the case when an infinite number of arguments passed in
        ```js
        function handleMany(a, b, ... rest) {
            console.log(`we have ${rest.length} additional parameters`);
            if (rest.length > 0) {
                console.log(`the third parameter is ${rest[0]}`);
            }
        }
        handleMany(1); // "we have 0 additional parameters"
        handleMany(1,2,3,4,5);
        // "we have 3 additional parameters"
        // "the third parameter is 3"
        ```

## Closures
- Background: global variables should prevented, since codes from different developers might collide global variable names with each other, and global variables are not secure
- Closures happen when functions are defined in specific contexts, especially when functions defined within other functions
- Functions defined inside of other functions retain access to local variables of functions they were defined within
    - when a function is defined, the function object is created with the parent stack frame within which it is called, and a variable with the same name will be created in the parent stack frame pointing to the function object
    - the call stack frame will not be popped out even it has been returned unless all function objects whose parent frame is it are not pointed, thus local variables in the parent stack frame get closured in the child function
    - when a function gets called, the new stack frame knows the parent stack frame from the function object, thus local variables closured can be accessed
        ```js
        function outer(x) {
            var outerX = x;
            function inner() {
                console.log(outerX);
            }
            return inner;
        }
        var ex1 = outer(12);
        ex1(); // "12"
        ```
    - different function objects will be created in different parent stack frame, with different local variables closured, thus parent stack frame is also an identification of function objects besides function names and variable numbers
        ```js
        var ex2 = outer(15);
        ex2(); // "15"
        ex1(); // "12"
        ```
- Closured functions (inner) can be defined as a parameter of a function (middle) called within an function (outer), in this case, when the middle function called the inner function outside the outer function, the local variables of the outer function can still be accessed
    ```js
    window.onload = function() { // outer function defined
    var currPic=0;
    var picArray = new Array("braun.jpg","gates.jpg","meyer.jpg", "quad.jpg","memchu.jpg");					   
    setInterval( // middler function called		   
        function() { // inner function defined
            currPic = currPic + 1;
            if (currPic >= picArray.length) {
                currPic = 0;
            }
            document.getElementById("photo").src = picArray[currPic];
        },
        3000);
    }
    ```
- Thus closures can prevent global variables by using local variables in an outer function
- Another usage for closures is when we want to pass custom parameters to event handlers using `addEventListener()` which can only take `event` as parameter, we can define a outer function that takes custom parameters and returns an event handler function accessing the custom local parameters, and thus similar event handlers can be easily created in the global scope with reused codes.
    ```js
    function createHandler(customData) {
        var data = customData;
        return function () {
            alert(`You pressed the ${data} button`);
        }
    }
    var aHandler = createHandler("A");
    var bHandler = createHandler("B");
    var cHandler = createHandler("C");
    document.getElementById("Able").addEventListener("click",aHandler);
    document.getElementById("Baker").addEventListener("click",bHandler);
    document.getElementById("Charlie").addEventListener("click",cHandler);
    ```
- `data-` attributes in tags can have similar effects, but closure is the traditional way to handle this
- Remember that closures can help declare private attributes in object type constructor functions, where the constuctor is the outer function, and methods (inner functions) defined within the constructor can access local variables (private attributes)
    ```js
    function Pair(x, y) {
        var _x = x;
        var _y = y;
        this.sum = function() {
            return _x + _y;
        }
        this.difference = function() {
            return _x + _y;
        }
    }
    ```
- Closures can also be used to create private variables or functions without the object type concept, everything inside a function is private unless explicitly returned, it should return anything we want made public (as a single object), and public function returned can access private attributes, which make it possible to import from modules
- Note that returned variables are not bounded to objects

## JavaScript Modules
- ECMAScript 6 supports modules
- If we want to export variables or fucntions from a js file, we can put `export` keyword in front of them, and they can be used outside this js file
    ```js
    // math.js
    export const pi = 3.14159;
    export const e = 2.71828;
    export function power(base, exp) {
        var result = 1;
        for (let i = 0; i < exp; i++) {
            result *= base;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```
- Other js files can import something they want explictly from a path without `.js` suffix by destructuring
    ```js
    import {pi, power} from "./math";
    console.log(pi);
    console.log(power(2, 10));
    ```
- Most browsers support modules

## Event Loop and Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript
- Events cannot be handled simultaneously, otherwise there might be possible conflicts
- Event handlers arisen will be added to a queue, if there is some other events are being handling, thus event handlers are run sequentially, which is a event loop model
- In other words, the event handler system is single-threaded
- While time consuming event handler is running, nothing works, hovering on different elems will not make elems or cursors change interactively, we canot interact with other buttons, etc
- In JS, we can use web workers to support multi-threaded programming system that can help handling events asynchronously and more efficiently
- `Worker` can run js files, within which some data (message) can be sent back to the `Worker` object in the original js file, within which the message events triggered by the other js file can be handled by `.onmessage`, note that the worker js file is executed by another thread
    ```js
    var worker;
    function handlePrime(event) {
        var primeOutput = document.getElementById("primes");
        primeOutput.value = primeOutput.value + ", " + event.data;
    }
    function findPrimes() {
        worker = new Worker("primes.js");
        worker.onmessage = handlePrime;
    }
    ```
- In the work js file, the message is sent by `this.postMessage()`
    ```js
    // primes.js
    var num = 1;
    function calculatePrimes() {
        var num = 1;
        while (true) {
            var isPrime = true;
            for(var i = 2; i < num; i++) {
                if (num % i == 0) {
                    isPrime = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isPrime) {
                this.postMessage(num); // messages are sent continuously to the worker in the original js file
            }
            num = num + 1;
        }
    }
    calculatePrimes();
    ```
- Workers can be stopped explicitly in the original file by `.terminate()`
    ```js
    function stopPrimes() {
        worker.terminate();
    }
    ```
- Note that although the worker is running continuously, the event handlers `onmessage` are still be put into a queue in the original thread, which means when other events are being handled, the `onmessage` handlers are not running but waiting, thus the event handling system is still single-threaded
- The worker can also post message from the original js file to the worker js file, where the event handler function can access the message data by the `event` parameter passed in as that in the original js file, thus messages can be sent back and forth between the original and the worker js files
- The `Worker` object created in the original js file is referenced as `this` (the global scope) in the worker js file
