## Arrow Functions
- 3 ways to define a function:
    - basic function:
        ```js
        function power(base, exponent) {
            var result = 1;
            for (var i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
                result = result * base;
            }
            return result;
        }
        ```
    - anonymous function:
        ```js
        var power = function(base, exponent) {
            var result = 1;
            for (var i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
                result = result * base;
            }
            return result;
        }
        ```
    - arrow function: (assign it to a var and can call the arrow function through var name)
        ```js
        var power = (base, exponent) => {
            var result = 1;
            for (var i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
                result = result * base;
            }
            return result;
        }
        console.log(power(2, 2));
        ```
- Arrow functions are used a bit under certain situations
- Arrow function literals can be called directly immediately (be careful about parenthese wrapping the arrow function!):
    ```js
    console.log(
        ((a, b) => {
            return a + b;
        })(3, 5)
    );
    ```
- If the arrow function just takes one param, can skip the parantheses around the parameter:
    ```js
    x => {
        return x + 3;
    }
    ```
- If the arrow function takes no params, need to provide an empty pair of parantheses
- If function body just contains one expression that we want to return, can skip the curly braces:
    ```js
    (a, b) => a + b
    ```
- But the object literal should be put in parentheses:
    ```js
    (a, b) => ({sum: a + b, product: a * b})
    ```
- Arrow function literals can be passed into other functions as parameters (e.g., as event handlers)

## Debugger on Web Browsers
- Web browsers are not designed primarily as development tools, but as consumer products
- In Chrome, console can be found in ... -> More Tools -> Developer Tools
- Useful console methods:
    - `console.log()` can print out strings, objects, etc
    - `console.dir()` can print out nicer form of objects
    - `console.dirxml()` can print out object in XML form (but few browsers support this)
- Debugger in Chrome is "Sources" tab next to "Console", where we can choose JS files and set breakpoints at lines to debug
- Console has filter to filter out specific message types: errors, warnings, logs, info, etc
- Important for software engineers to master using debuggers
