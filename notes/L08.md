## Destructuring
- Destructuring is a technique to retrieve data from a JavaScript object or array and store it in a more convenient or accessible format
- It seems like we are declaring a new object with properties from an existing object, and the property names of the new object can be accessed by the general scope
- Note that we have to use `var` instead of `let`, otherwise the general scope cannot access variables defined in a pair of curly braces (object)
- We can extract certain properties from an object by property names and the ordering does not matter
    ```js
    var ex = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};
    var {a, d} = ex;
    var {c, b} = ex;
    console.log(a); // 1
    console.log(b); // 2
    console.log(c); // 3
    console.log(d); // 4
    ```
- We can initialize some default values for properties
    ```js
    var {a = 10, d = 20, e = 30} = ex;
    console.log(e); // 30
    ```
- We can also rename the results which will not declare a variable whose name is the property name
    ```js
    var a = 12, b = 15;
    var {a: x, b: y} = ex;
    console.log(x); // 1
    console.log(y); // 2
    console.log(a); // 12
    console.log(b); // 15
    ```
- If the variables are already defined, just using curly braces will be a syntax error since JS will think we are writing a block of code (curly braces have different contexts), we can use parentheses to prevent ambiguity
    ```js
    var a, b;
    {a, b} = ex; // error
    ({a, b} = ex); // valid
    ```
- Destructing also works with arrays, where variables get processed are basically in order
    ```js
    var ex = ["alpha", "bravo", "charlie", "delta"];
    var [a, b] = ex;
    console.log(a); // "alpha"
    console.log(b); // "bravo"
    ```
- We can skip items
    ```js
    var [a, , , d] = ex;
    console.log(a); // "alpha"
    console.log(d); // "delta"
    ```
- We can also wrap remaining items all in one variable
    ```js
    var [a, b, ... rest] = ex;
    console.log(rest); // ["charlie", "delta"]
    ```
- We can also set default values
    ```js
    var [a = "able", b = "baker", c = "charlie", d = "dog", e = "echo"] = ex;
    console.log(a); // "alpha"
    console.log(c); // "charlie"
    console.log(e); // "echo"
    ```
- Destructing is handy for import and output
    - a module can output a bunch of stuffs, but we can only import what we are interested by destructing
        ```js
        function importMathStuff() { 
            return {
                pi: 3.14,
                e: 2.71828,
                power: (base, exp) => {
                    let result = 1;
                    for(let i=0; i<exp; i++) {
                        result *= base;
                    }
                    return result;
                }
            };
        }
        var {pi, power} = importMathStuff(); // not interested in e
        var radius = 1;
        console.log(2 * pi * radius);
        console.log(power(2,10));
        ```
    - also supports return multiple values (in one single object)

## JavaScript Objects
- Objects can be defined as object literal (property-value pairs), properties are strings (or symbols) but not quoted
    ```js
    var example = {
		name: "Molly",
		nickname: "FloPup",
		canine: true,
		age: 8
	};
    ```
- We can access properties of an object by either '.' or square brackets (properties should be quoted, otherwise a variable with the name as the property will be access, and the actually property accessed will be the value of that variable)
    ```js
    example.age = example.age + 1;
    example["age"] = example["age"] + 1;
    var key = "age";
    example[key] = example[key] + 1; // equivalent to above
    ```
- New properties can be added after an object is created by either way
    ```js
    example.dorm = "Florence Moore Hall";
    example["university"] = "Stanford";
    ```
- `for ... in` can iterate over properties of the object and properties inherited by the object, we can use `.hasOwnProperty()` to check if a property is on the object, not one inherited
    ```js
    for (let prop in example) {
        if (example.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            console.log(prop + ": " + example[prop]); // note that prop is string, cannot use '.' to access that property
        }
    }
    ```
- Objects can use numberic properties, just like arrays, and the index number will serve as property same as strings, and note that objects are dynamic and sparse
    ```js
    example[0] = "hello";
    example[1] = "goodbye";
    example[20] = "sparse";
    ```
- When we iterate through using `for ... in`, we get both the "named" properties and the "numbered" properties, and actually "numbered" properties will be converted to "name" properties literally and thus affect exisiting properties
- But note that objects do not have length
    ```js
    console.log(example.length); // undefined
    ```

## JavaScript Arrays
- Arrays are also objects, they can be defined literally or constructed by a standard object constructor
    ```js
    var array1 = ["hello", "goodbye", "test"];
    var array2 = new Array("hello", "goodbye", "test");
    ```
- Arrays are also sparse and dynamic, `for ... in` only iterates through items defined
    ```js
    array1[20] = "sparse";
    array1[35] = "efficient";
    for (let prop in array1) { // prop is each defined index
        if (anArray.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            console.log(prop + " : " + anArray[prop]);
        }
    }
    ```
- `for ... of` can also iterate over items by the values themselves, but it wiil list all elems including empty undefined ones
    ```js
    for (let item of array1) {
        console.log(item);
    }
    ```
- Arrays have a special `length` property
- Arrays also have special methods on them, like `push()`, `sort()`
- Since arrays are also objects, we can add regular properties to arrays, but they will not count toward length and will not be iterated by `for ... of`
    ```js
    array1.newProp = "New Non-Indexed Property";
    array1.another = "Awesome New Property";
    ```

## JavaScript Array-Like Objects
- Many methods return array-like objects, like `document.getElementsByTagName()` and these allow us to do some array-like operations, but not everything available on a real array
- Strings are also array-like objects
- `for ... of` can iterate over any iterable objects, including arrays and array-like objects
- Any array-like objects have `length` property, thus we can use a traditional `for` loop on array-like objects
- But only arrays can arise `forEach()`, which can call a function taking one or two parameters (item and index) on each item
    ```js
    realArray.forEach(item => console.log(item));
    realArray.forEach((item, index) => console.log(`${index}: ${item}`)); // note the order of the two paremeters
    ```

## JavaScript Methods
- Methods are functions attached to objects, can be defined in an object literal, just like general properties, `this` will refer to the object itself
    ```js
    var example = {
		name: "Molly",
		nickname: "FloPup",
		canine: true,
		age: 8,
		printInfo: function() {
			console.log(this.name);
		}
	};
    ```
- We can add a method after we defined the object just like general properties
    ```js
    example.detailedInfo = function() {
		console.log(this.name);
		console.log(this.age);
	};
    ```
- We can also define a function first and then attach that function as method on an object, which shows the duality of functions and methods
    ```js
    function printAge() {
        console.log(this.age);
    }
    example.getAge = printAge;
    example.getAge(); // 8
    ```
- If a function is called directly without an object, `this` in the function will refer to the global scope
    ```js
    var age = 2;
    printAge(); // 2
    ```
- `this.` should be specified to property names in object method bodies, otherwise a variable name might refer to a global variable, which will cause ambiguity
    ```js
    var x = "globalX";
    var obj = {
        x: "instanceX",
        badGetX: function () {
            console.log("badGetX retrieves " + x);
        },
        getX: function () {
            console.log("getX retrieves " + this.x);
        }
    };    
    obj.badGetX(); // "globalX"
    obj.getX(); // "instanceX"
    ```
- But within a global function, variables without `this.` will first look up the name in the local scope, while variables with `this.` will access variables in the global scope, which is different from object methods
    ```js
    var x = "globalX"
    function example() {
        var x = "localX";
        console.log(x); // "localX"
        console.log(this.x); // "globalX"
    }
    example();
    ``` 
- If we want to call a object method within another object method, we should also specify `this.` to the called function, otherwise the called function will refer to a funtion defined in the global scope
    ```js
    var x = "globalX";
    var obj = {
        x: "instanceX",
        getX: function () {
            console.log(this.x);
        },
        badCaller: function() {
            getX();
        },
        goodCaller: function() {
            this.getX();
        }
    };  
    obj.goodCaller(); // "instanceX"
    obj.badCaller(); // ERROR, getX() is not found in the global scope
    ```
- `this` depends on which object arises the method, or the function is a global function with no objects arising it, even if the function is defined as a global function, `this` can refer to an object if the function is assigned as an object method
    ```js
    var x = "globalX";
    var obj = {
        x: "instanceX",
        badCaller: function() {
            getX();
        },
        goodCaller: function() {
            this.getX();
        }
    };
    function getX() {
        console.log(this.x);
    }
    obj.getX = getX; // assign function to object method
    obj.goodCaller(); // "instanceX"
    obj.badCaller(); // "globalX"
    ```
- If we want to call a global function by an object, we can assign it as a method associated with the object, or instead use `apply()` on the function
    - a function including references to `this` can arise `apply()` taking an object, which will actually make the object arise the function as its method
        ```js
        function printInfo() {
            console.log("Name: " + this.name);
            console.log("Dorm: " + this.dorm);
        }
        printInfo.apply({name: "Bonnie", dorm: "FloMo", age: 21});
        // "Name: Boonie"
        // "Dorm: FloMo"
        ```
    - in this case, a function could be a general method for any object, if applicable
    - if the function takes parameters, parameters can be passed as an array as the second parameter of `apply()`
        ```js
        function makeOlder(years) {
            this.age = this.age + years;
            console.log("Now Age: " + this.age);
        }

        makeOlder.apply({name: "Bonnie", age: 21}, [3]); // "Now Age: 24"
        ```
- `call()` is very similar to `apply()`, except taking parameters of the called functions directly after the object instead of an array of parameters
    ```js
    makeOlder.call({name: "Bonnie", age: 21}, 3);
    ```
- `bind()` takes an existing function and an object and creates a new function that the new function calls the original function arised the object provided
    - it does not need parameters for the method since it does not call the returned method immediately
        ```js
        var makeBonnieOlder = makeOlder.bind({name: "Bonnie", age: 21});
        makeBonnieOlder(3);
        ```
    - it can actually also take part of parameters of the method to be called, which will be bound along with the object and the returned method
        ```js
        var makeBonnieThreeYearsOlder = makeOlder.bind({name: "Bonnie", age: 21}, 3);
        makeBonnieThreeYearsOlder();
        ```
    - it is handy for assigning handler function, especially when we want to add a list of similar event handlers on similar elems, since `.addEventListener()` need a function as the second parameter
        ```js
        var options = [
            {name: "Sports",
            price: 1800},
            {name: "Standard",
            price: 1500},
            {name: "Economy",
            price: 1200} 
        ];
        for (var opt of options) {
            var newHeader = document.createElement("h1");
            newHeader.innerHTML = opt.name;
            newHeader.addEventListener("click",
                (function() {
                    alert("price:" + this.price); // opt will not be explictly referenced within the function body
                }).bind(opt), // opt will be referenced by this in the function body
            false);
            document.documentElement.appendChild(newHeader);
        }
        ```

## JavaScript Object Prototype Hierarchy
- Traditional JS does not have concept of classes, but prototypes
- Difference of classes versus prototypes: classes are not objects, but prototypes are
- Constructor is a function meant to be called in a special context
    - constructors are not wrapped by a class, they look like general functions
    - in JS constructors actually end up serving as object types
        ```js
        function Pair(a, b) {
            this.a = a;
            this.b = b;
            this.sum = function() {
                        console.log(this.a + this.b);
                    };
            this.difference = function() {
                        console.log(this.a - this.b);
                    };
        }
        ```
    - to construct an object, constructor should be called using `new` keyword
        ```js
        var pairOne = new Pair(12,8);
        var pairTwo = new Pair(5,10);   
        ```
    - `new` creates a new object and calls the constructor with that newly created object as `this`
    - it is legal to call constructor without `new`, in which case it works as a general function, `this` within it will refer to the global scope
- All objects constructed with the same constructor share a prototype object, and prototypes have hierarchy, thus prototype relations can be chained
- Prototype object of objects constructed by a constructor can be accessed and modified by the constructor object by `.prototype`
    ```js
    function Pair(a, b) {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
    }
    Pair.prototype.sum = function() {
                    console.log(this.a + this.b);
                };
    Pair.prototype.difference = function() {
                    console.log(this.a - this.b);
                };
    ```
- Properties or methods defined on the prototype are not defined on constructed objects, but any properties looked for that are not on the object itself are searched for on the prototype
    ```js
    var pairOne = new Pair(12,8);
    var pairTwo = new Pair(5,10);
    pairOne.sum();
    pairTwo.difference();
    ```
- We can set the prototype of a object type as another object, but the constructor of the object type will be overwritten by prototype object since the constructor of the object type is bounded to its prototype (for which all objects can share the same constructor), thus we should reassign the `constructor` of the object type (which is accessed by its prototype) back
    ```js
    function StanfordPerson() {
        this.school = "Stanford";
    }
    function StanfordStudent(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    StanfordStudent.prototype = new StanfordPerson();
    StanfordStudent.prototype.constructor = StanfordStudent; // just remember this weird feature!
    var john = new StanfordStudent("John");
    ```
- If we assign a new property to an object, it will not affect the prototype, the property will be added to the object itself and the prototype can have the same property key with a different value
    ```js
    function StanfordEmployee(name,salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    StanfordEmployee.prototype = new StanfordPerson();
    StanfordEmployee.prototype.constructor = StanfordEmployee;
    var mary = new StanfordEmployee("Mary",100000);
    var kate = new StanfordEmployee("Kate",120000);
    var rob = new StanfordEmployee("Rob",90000);
    mary.school = "Harvard";
    console.log(mary.school); // "Harvard"
    console.log(kate.school); // "Stanford"
    ```
- Properties on the prototype itself can also be changed, and this affects every object with that prototype
    ```js
    StanfordEmployee.prototype.school = "Leland Stanford";
    console.log(kate.school); // "Leland Stanford"
    console.log(rob.school); // "Leland Stanford"
    ```
- Different prototypes of different object types are different objects, although they might share the same prototype, thus properties among different prototype objects cannot affect each other
    ```js
    console.log(john.school); // "Stanford"
    // note john is a StanfordStudent, whose prototype is another StanfordPerson object different from the prototype of the StanfordEmployee objects
    ```
- Properties on specific objects can be explicitly deleted
    ```js
    console.log(mary.school); // "Havard"
    delete mary.school;
    console.log(mary.school); // "Leland Stanford"
    ```
- Different object types can share a same object as prototype, with one `new`, in which modification to the prototype object can affect both object types
    ```js
    var stanfordSharedBase = new StanfordPerson();
    StanfordStudent.prototype = stanfordSharedBase;
    StanfordEmployee.prototype = stanfordSharedBase;
    ```
- `for ... in` iterates over all properties either on the object or on its prototype all the way up the prototype chain, we can restrict this with `.hasOwnProperty` to iterate over only properties on the object itself
    ```js
    for (let prop in obj) { // prop is each defined index
        if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            console.log(prop + " : " + obj[prop]);
        }
    }
    ```

## JavaScript Classes
- Classes were added as an ECMAScript 6 (ES2015) feature
- Class declaration in JS is similar to other languages, but attributes are not required to be declared in advance, and `this` should be always attached if desirable
    ```js
    class Pair {
        constructor(x,y) { // the constructor name is literally constructor
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
        sum() {
            return this.x + this.y;
        }       
        difference() {
            return this.x - this.y;
        }
    }
    ```
- Private variables and methods were added in ECMAScript 2020 and are indicated by the number sign `#`, but these are not currently supported by some tools (JSLint, JSHint, etc)or JS interpreters
- The traditional workaround is use closures, where private attributes are not bounded to `this` but only defined in the `constructor` body and thus method should also be defined within the `constructor` body and the name convention for private attributes is starting with `_`
    ```js
    class Pair {
        constructor(x, y) {
            var _x = x;
            var _y = y;
            this.sum = function() {
                return _x + _y;
            };         
            this.difference = function() {
                return _x - _y;
            };
        }
    }
    ```
- Classes also have hierarchy, thus classes can inherit from other classes by `extends` and constructor of superclass can be called as `super()`
    ```js
    class NamedPair extends Pair {
        constructor(x, y, name) {
            super(x, y); // call the constructor of superclass
            this.name = name;
        } 
        allInfo() {
            return this.sum() + this.name + this.difference();
        }
    }
    ```

## JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
- JSON is a common way of storing and transferring data between different locations
- XML is another common format to transfer data
- JSON is literal strings very similar to JS objects, except that property names are quoted
- JSON can be converted to JS objects by `JSON.parse()` (note the quotes)
    ```js
    var ex = JSON.parse('{"name": "patrick", "dog": "molly"}');
    ```
- Objects can also be converted to JSON strings by `JSON.stringify()`
    ```js
    var output = JSON.stringify({name: "patrick", dog: "molly"});
    ```
- Note that `JSON.stringify()` will get into trouble if the object has a loop in it
    ```js
    ex.self = ex;
    var trouble = JSON.stringify(ex);
    ```
- Methods cannot be put in JSON

## Asides
- `forEach()` is a method of prototype of arrays, thus it can only be arised by arrays not array-like objects, but we can explictly retrieve methods from the `Array.prototype` and use them on array-like objects
    ```js
    var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
    Array.prototype.forEach.apply(paragraphs,
        [item => {
            console.log(item.innerText);
        }]
    );
    ```
