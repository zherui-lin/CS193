# JQuery
- JQuery had huge impacts in the past for 10-15 years, but new projects do not tend to use it any more
- JQuery fits in all platforms, which was a big deal in the past
- Thus understanding jQuery is important, particularly when we want to modify some old websites
- JQuery library can be simply imported into a html page by `<script>`, its source file is pretty small
    ```html
    <script src="jquery-3.2.1.js"></script>
    ```
- JQuery variables in normal scripts begin with a `$` sign, which will not pollute the global namespace, `$` can take a CSS query string as parameter, and can access elems on the page for developers to manipulate, e.g., `$("li")`
- These variables are called wrapped sets or jQuery objects, which are array-like objects, and they can arise several methods, which are referred to jQuery calls, such as `.addClass()` and `.bind()`, which are similar to `.classList.add()` and `.addEventListener()`
    ```js
    function changeStuff() {
        $("li").addClass("redElements");
        $("ul li").addClass("greenElements");
        $("#oski").addClass("blueElements");
        $("li:nth-child(4)").addClass("purpleElements");
    }
    $("#theButton").bind("click",changeStuff);
    ```
- JQuery has its own query selector format, such as pseudo classes like `:hidden` and `:visible`
    ```js
    function makeVisible() {
        $("li:hidden").show();
    }
    function makeHidden() {
        $("li:visible").hide();
    }
    $("#visibleButton").bind("click", makeVisible);
    $("#invisibleButton").bind("click", makeHidden);
    ```
- Methods of wrapped sets usually return the same wrapped set objects, thus wrapped sets can call chaining methods
    ```js
    $("li").addClass("redElements").addClass("underlinedElements");
    ```
- Wrapped sets are array-like objects, thus single elems can be retrieved by subscription, and the elems are DOM objects that we can manipulate
    ```js
    $("li").addClass("redElements");
	$("li")[0].innerHTML = "Hello";
    ```
- Note that jQuery calls can not be applied to DOM elems themselves
- JQuery calls can either retieve or set values by the same method name, depending on whether it takes parameters or not
    - jQuery calls can simply access or modify the offset (relative to the window), position (relative to the container), size and contents
        ```js
        var offset = $("#theDiv").offset(); // access
    	$("#textField").val("top: " + offset.left + ", left: " + offset.top);
        $("#theDiv").offset({top: 100, left: 15}); // modification
        var position = $("#weirdText").position();
    	$("#textField").val("top: " + position.left + ", left: " + position.top);
        $("#textField").val($("#theDiv").width());
        $("#theDiv").width(parseInt($("#textField").val()));
        ```
    - inner HTMLs or inner texts can also be retrieved or modified by `.html()` or `.text()`, note that when we use `.html()` to retrieve inner HTMLs from a wrapped set, we can only get that of the first elem, but setting will be made to all elems
        ```js
        $("#textField").val($("li").html()); // first elem only
        $("#textField").val($("li").text()); // all elems
        $("li").html($("#textField").val()); // all elems
        $("li").text($("#textField").val()); // all elems
        ```
- `.bind()` is very similar to `.addEventListener()`, which can take a function and pass an `event` object to the handler containing the event info
- there is a jQuery call similar to `defer`, which is `$(document).ready()`, which will only execute the function passed in after the elems in the wrapped set are ready
    ```js
    $(document).ready(function() {
		$("#getHTMLButton").bind("click",getHTML);
		$("#getTextButton").bind("click",getText);
		$("#setHTMLButton").bind("click",setHTML);
		$("#setTextButton").bind("click",setText);
	});
    ```
- JQuery supports different kinds of animations straightforwardly, including fade-in, fade-out, and general animations, but now CSS does support these functions
    ```js
    $("#logo").fadeIn(2000);
    $("#logo").fadeOut(2000);
    $("#logo").fadeOut(2000, fadeIn);
    $("#theDiv").animate(
		{left: "+=150",
		top: "+=150"},
		5000
	);
    $("h1").animate(
		{fontSize: "+=50"},
		5000
	);
    ```

## JQuery User Interface
- JQuery UI is a customized library sets on top of jQuery, that provides multiple powerful functional UI and we can choose what we want from
- We can select and download the library files from https://jqueryui.com/download/
- Functions provided by jQuery UI are pretty easy to manipulate by jQuery, by just using simple jQuery calls, but these jQuery calls should be writed within a function in a jQuery expression
    ```js
    $(function() {
        $("h1").resizable();
        $("h1").draggable();
        $("h1").draggable({axis: "y"}); // only draggable on the y axis
		$("#quad").draggable({containment: "parent"}); // only draggable within the parent
    })
    ```
- JQuery UI is pretty handy but it might make pages messy and arise some bugs in some platforms, thus be careful of using it
  
# Bootstrap
- Sometimes referred to Twitter Bootstrap
- It provides nice webpage layouts, icons, etc
- The main shortcoming is that all websites designed from Bootstrap look similar, which is not a big deal for internal websites, but is a big problem for customer-facing websites
- Bootstrap source files can be simply imported into html pages, and both stylesheet and script should be imported, note that they are all minified files
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.min.css" />
    <script src="bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    ```
- Bootstrap provides some predefined container classes, which will display the contents in fixed width, with the size increasing as the window reaches each breakpoint, the sizes for each containers are sm: 576px, md: 768px, lg: 992px, xl: 1200px, xxl: 1400px
    ```html
    <h1 class="container-sm">Small Container</h1>
    <h1 class="container-md">Medium Container</h1>  
    <h1 class="container-lg">Large Container</h1>
    ```
- Bootstrap also provides some predefined column classes, which will divide Bootstraps predefined 12 columns between different divs as specified by the classes used, the key class names are `row` and `col`
    ```html
    <div class="container text-center">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
            Equal Sized Left
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">
            Equal Sized Right
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-3">
            Narrow
            </div>
            <div class="col-9">
            Wide
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-4">
            Equal
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
            Equal
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
            Equal
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```
- If we want to add CSS rules to elems with classed defined in frameworks, we can use `[]` with conditions in the selector
    ```css
    div[class="row"] {
        border: 0px;
    }
    ```
- The column-based layout can dynamically respond to the current size of the container optionally, by setting size keyword into class names, such as `col-md-6`, `col-lg-4`, etc, but note that it is better to make the sum in each version as 12
    ```html
    <div class="container text-center">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-3 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
            Left
            </div>
            <div class="col-8 col-md-5 col-lg-4">
            Right
            </div>
            <div class="col-1 col-lg-4">
            Far
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

# Node (Node.js)
- Node is a general runtime system, that runs JS on the computer, and one of its main functions is that it can act as a web server, after all it is a JS execution environment
- Node has two working versions, Long Term Support (LTS) version and current version, LTS is recommended for most users but does not include the lastest features
- Node can be run in the terminal, which will work as a JS interpreter, but it might has minor difference from running in a browser due to version difference
- JS files can be run by node in the terminal, with or without the suffix `.js`, the print out message by `console.log()` will show in the terminal
    ```zsh
    node example.js
    node example
    ```
- Node supports numerical modules, and we can access these built-in modules in JS file using `require()`, which will return a variable that can fetch everything in that modules
    ```js
    var fs = require("fs");
    if(fs.existsSync("example.js")) {
        console.log("example.js exists");
    } else {
        console.log("example.js does not exist");    
    }
    ```
- In node modules, generally operations have a synchronous version and an asynchronous version
    - Synchronous version will make operations immediately when the method is called
        ```js
        var stat = fs.statSync("example.js");
        if(stat.isFile()) {
            console.log("example.js is a file");
        } else {
            console.log("example.js is not a file");    
        }
        console.log("Okay, we've finished calling statSynch"); // print out later
        ```
    - Asynchronous version will take a callback function instead
        ```js
        function handleStat(err,stat) {
            if(err) {
                console.log("handleStat returned error");
                return;
            }
            if(stat.isFile()) {
                console.log("example.js is a file");
            } else {
                console.log("example.js is not a file");    
            }
        }
        var stat = fs.stat("example.js",handleStat);
        console.log("Okay, we've finished calling stat"); // print out first
        ```
- The basic way to learn how to use a module is to follow the handout (LTS version) and the documentations at https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/index.html

## Node as Web Server
- A simpler version of node web server is using `http` module, the callback function can specify HTTP request-response rules, `.listen()` will specify what connection (URL) the server with the specified rules will be triggered by, the port number passed in `.listen()` will refer to the connection of localhost, thus the connection can be triggered by URL `http://localhost:<number>`
    ```js
    var http = require('http');
    var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
        response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
        response.end("Hello World!");
    });
    server.listen(8080);
    ```
- When we execute the server JS file in the terminal, the program just keeps running
- We can also specify HTTP request-response rules based on the request details such as contents of URL, e.g., pathname, which can be parsed by `url` module
    ```js
    var http = require('http');
    var url = require('url');
    var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
        var urlInfo = url.parse(request.url,true);
        if (urlInfo.pathname == "/simple.html") {
            response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
            response.end("Simple Request");
        } else if (urlInfo.pathname == "/complex.html") {
            response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
            response.write("<b>Complex Request</b><br />");
            response.write("Your name is " + urlInfo.query.name + "<br />");
            response.write("Your phone is " + urlInfo.query.phone + "<br />");
            response.end();
        } else {
            response.writeHead(404, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
            response.end("404 Not Found :-(");
        }
    });
    server.listen(8080);
    ```
- The connection (URL) can be triggered by `action` attribute of `<form>` elems as well, and the action can be triggered by `<input type="submit">`
    - Remember input values will be passed into URL as queries, which can be parsed can accessed by `.query.<name>`
        ```html
        <form action="http://localhost:8080/simple.html">
        <input type="submit" />
        </form>
        <form action="http://localhost:8080/complex.html">
        Name: <input type="text" name="name" /><br />
        Phone: <input type="text" name="phone" />
        <input type="submit" />
        </form>
        ```
- The connection can also be triggered by anchor link
    ```html
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/notfound.html"><h2>Uh Oh</h2></a>
    ```
- If we use the `http` module, all rules should be written in a single `server` variable, which will be messy
- A more descent version of node web server is using `express` module, where we can use `app = express()` variable to add as many rules as we want more gracefully
    ```js
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.send('Hello World!');
    });
    var server = app.listen(3000, function () {
        var host = server.address().address; // weird here
        var port = server.address().port; // server can be accessed before the value is returned
        console.log('Example app listening at http://%s:%s', host, port); // print out in the terminal
    });
    ```
- `app` can create a simple rules for static files, where static files with the pathname passed into the request URL will be opened, which is not supported by `http` module
    ```js
    app.use(express.static('.'));
    ```
- `app` can add various rules on URL requests with different pathnames (hierarchical portions)
    ```js
    var url = require('url');
    app.get('/simple.html', function (req, res) {
        res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
        res.end("Simple Request");
    });
    app.get('/complex.html', function (req, res) {
        var urlInfo = url.parse(req.url,true);
        res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
        res.write("<b>Complex Request</b><br />");
        res.write("Your name is " + urlInfo.query.name + "<br />");
        res.write("Your phone is " + urlInfo.query.phone + "<br />");
        res.end();
    });
    ```
- `app` can also process URL with `*`
    ```js
    app.get('/var*.html', function (req, res) {
        var urlInfo = url.parse(req.url,true);
        res.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
        res.end("various");
    });
    ```
- `app` can take the default request as 404
    ```js
    app.use(function (req, res) {
        res.writeHead(404, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
        res.end("Not Found");
    });
    ```

# MongoDB
- Generally a database can support persistent storage, application access, tansaction management and efficient search, where the first two are also supported by file systems
- MongoDB is a NoSQL database, and it stores data as JSONs
- Traditional relational databases usually have only one center database, but noSQL databases can handle this problem
- MongoDB stores data as key-value pairs, in JSONs
- MongoDB commands can be made in the terminal
- All searching is carried by JS objects
- MongoDB supports adding new properties to specific JS objects (JSONs), which is impossible for relational databases
