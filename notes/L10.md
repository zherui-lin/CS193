## Tips on Assignment
- Photo Gallery
    - be careful about positioning, especially about `position: absolute` for nested elems, which will be relative to parents but not the window
    - to confirm the positions of invisible elems, can set `background-color` to temporarily display these elems
- Maps
    - zooming in or out actually switch image files with different resolutions but not actually zooming in or out the same image
    - to crop the map image by the frame, we should set `overflow: hidden` to the parent elem (div) of the image
    - `"mousemove"` events have a drag-and-drop framework, which will be handled with smaller opaque elems moving around with the mouse, and since the events should be handled entirely by ourselves, we should call `event.preventDefault()` in the handler body
    - better to place event handlers on the document, not specific elems, otherwise `"mousemove"` or `"mouseup"` events will get lost if the mouse moves faster than the moving elem and outside it
    - `event.clientX` and `event.clientY` for the mouse are the positions relative to the window, regardless which elems add the event handlers, thus we have to make calculations for new positions, we can draw out the scratch for the layout relationship by hand
    - zooming in or out should make the center fixed, which also require us to make calculations on positions for new images
    - better to preload all images in advance

## `window` as Global Context
- In browser based JS the global context can be accessed by the `window` object, or we can also explicitly access global variables by `window`
    ```js
    var x = 12;
    console.log(window.x);
    window.y = 15;
    console.log(y);
    ```
- To check if a feature is available (not `undefined`), we can simply put it in a `if` statement to test it
    - for a propertie on objects, we can access the feature to check by the object
        ```js
        if (location.href) {
            console.log("Supports Location's href Property");
        } else {
            console.log("No Support for Location's href Property");
        }
        ```
    - for a top-level function or global variable, we can take advantage of the fact that all global variables are properties of the `window` object
        ```js
        if (window.location) {
            console.log("location global variable exists");
        } else {
            console.log("Does not have a location global variable");
        }
        ```
    - note that we cannot try to directly access a top-level function or global variable, otherwise the codes will crash if that feature does not exist
- `window` has method `open()` that can open a new html file as a popup and return a new `window` variable of the popup, and the original global context can get attributes from the new global variable from the new popup
    ```html
    <!-- main.html -->
    <input type="text" size="8" id="valueDisplay" />
    <input type="button" value="Create Popup"
       onclick="popupWin = window.open('popup.html','popup','width=300,height=80'); popupWin.focus();" />
    <input type="button" value="Get Popup Variable" 
       onclick="if(popupWin) document.getElementById('valueDisplay').value = popupWin.popupVar;" />

    <!-- popup.html -->
    <input type="text" size="8" id="valueDisplay" />
    <input type="button" value="Set Popup Variable" 
       onclick="popupVar = document.getElementById('valueDisplay').value;" />
    ```

# JavaScript Strings
- JS does not have a char data type
- There is a primitive type for strings and also a string object type, which has methods, and they can be converted to each other if applicable
- Strings are immutable in JS
- Strings have attributes such as `length`, methods such as `indexOf()`, `substring()`, `charAt()`, etc
- `charAt()` will also return a string but not a char, but it works as the same as a proposed char, e.g., can be compared with other strings easily

# Cookies and Web Storage
- Cookies are used to stored info for websites on our local web browsers
- Concept of cookies is designed to work within the sandbox security model, which does not allow the browser to access a file system
- Browsers are basically in the sandbos security model, but some add-ons or extensions might go beyond the sandbox
- The tradition format of cookies is attribute-value pairs, where values are strings
- Example of logging in process is that every time you come back to a website, the cookie containing the user info will be sent to the server and the user will be automatically logged in
- Cookie can be set by `document.cookie`, where we should avoid some certain characters in the cookie by `escape()`, and it is better to set a expire date for the cookie by convert a date to string by `.toGMTString()`, otherwise it will live forever in the browser
    ```js
    function setCookie(cookieName, cookieValue) {
        var expDate = new Date();
        expDate.setFullYear(expDate.getFullYear() + 1);
        document.cookie = cookieName + "=" + escape(cookieValue) + "; expires=" + expDate.toGMTString();
    }
    ```
- However, retriving cookies from `document.cookie` will get all cookies that the browser can get, which will be not only what we have set, instead it contains much more attribute-value pairs, so actually `document.cookie` does not work like a property
- Thus we have to locate the cookie name (attribute name) we want and the following semicolon from the cookies
    ```js
    function getCookie(cookieName) {
        var allCookies = document.cookie;
        var startName = allCookies.indexOf(cookieName);
        if (startName == -1) {
            return "";  // if no cookie found, return the empty string
        }
        var startValue = startName + cookieName.length + 1;
        var endValue = allCookies.indexOf(";", startValue);
        if (endValue == -1) {
            endValue = allCookies.length;
        }
        return allCookies.substring(startValue, endValue);
        }
    ```
- To clear a cookie, we can reset the cookie with the same cookie name and set the expire date (just behind it) as a past time, and the value of the cookie itself can be anything
    ```js
    function clearCookie(cookieName) {
        var expDate = new Date();
        expDate.setFullYear(expDate.getFullYear() - 1);
        document.cookie = cookieName + "=foo"
                + "; expires=" + expDate.toGMTString();
    }
    ```
- The number of cookies a browser can take is limited
- Cookies are much more useful when communicating with servers, but if we only want to make operations on the client side, web storage will be easily
    - there are two types of web storage: local storage and session storage, which can be accessed by objects `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, respectively, where session storage can survive a page refresh, and local storage can survive even a full browser restart and thus it is persistent
    - web storage can be set easily by `storage.setItem()`
        ```js
        function getAppropriateStorage() {
            if (document.getElementById("data").sessType[0].checked) {
                return localStorage;
            } else {
                return sessionStorage;
            }
        }
        function setValue() {
            var storage = getAppropriateStorage();
            var key = document.getElementById("keyName").value;
            var value = document.getElementById("keyValue").value;   
            storage.setItem(key,value);
        }
        ```
    - web storage can be got by `storage.getItem()`
        ```js
        function getValue() {
            var storage = getAppropriateStorage();
            var key = document.getElementById("keyName").value;

            document.getElementById("keyValue").value = storage.getItem(key);
        }
        ```
    - web storage can be also be removed or cleared easily
        ```js
        function clearValue() {
            var storage = getAppropriateStorage();
            var key = document.getElementById("keyName").value;
            storage.removeItem(key);
        }
        function clearAllValues() {
            var storage = getAppropriateStorage();
            storage.clear();
        }
        ```
    - web storage can not communicate with servers, thus its usage is limited

## JavaScript Exception Handling
- Exceptions can be handled by `try ... catch` statements
    ```js
    try {
        var x = y;
    } catch {
        console.log("there was an error");
    }
    ```
- Exceptions can be thrown among general codes by `throw`
    ```js
    fucntion getUniversity() {
        var univ = prompt("what is your university?");
        if (univ == "Cal") {
            throw new Error("Unacceptable University");
        }
    }
    try {
        getUniversity();
    } catch (err) {
        console.log("Answer was unacceptable");
    }
    ```
- We can also create new types of errors by specifying its `name`, `message` and `stack`, and set its prototype as a `Error` object, `instanceof` can check if an object is of certain type
    ```js
    function UnacceptableError(message) {
        this.name = "UnacceptableError";
        this.message = message;
        this.stack = (new Error()).stack;
    }
    UnacceptableError.prototype = new Error();
    fucntion getUniversity() {
        var univ = prompt("what is your university?");
        if (univ == "Cal") {
            throw new UnacceptableError("Unacceptable University");
        }
    }
    try {
        getUniversity();
    } catch (err) {
        if (err instanceof UnacceptableError) { 
            console.log("Answer was unacceptable");
        }
    } 
    ```

## Geolocation
- `navigator.geolocation` can get the geolocation of the current user by `.getCurrentPosition()`
- But since the geolocation might not be got immediately, we should pass a call back function to `.getCurrentPosition()`, so that when the geoposition is ready, it will be passed into the call back function and call it
    ```js
    function getInfo() {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(theCallback);
    }
    function theCallback(position) {
        var theForm = document.getElementById("geoinfo");
        theForm.latitude.value = position.coords.latitude;
        theForm.longitude.value = position.coords.longitude;
    }
    ```

## Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and Canvas
- SVG is sort of Extensible Markup Language (XML), graphs can be defined by elems (tags, attributes, etc) in text file
- Outside the `<svg>` elems in the HTML file, we can also support general html elems like `<input>` and can handle events by modifying elems in `<svg>` in JS scripts
- SVG can be animated and controlled by Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL)
- `<canvas>` elems are designed for programming graphs instead of specifying graphs as `<svg>`
- `<canvas>` objects in JS can simply apply methods arised by `.getContext()` object to draw graphs on itself or modify itself
    ```js
    var theCanvas = document.getElementById("theCanvas");
    var theContext = theCanvas.getContext("2d");
    var theForm = document.getElementById("rectInfo");
    function createRect() {
	theContext.fillStyle = "#cc0000";
	theContext.fillRect(theForm.x.value,theForm.y.value,
					theForm.width.value,theForm.height.value);
    }
    function resizeCanvas() {
        theCanvas.width = theForm.width.value;
        theCanvas.height = theForm.height.value;
    }
    ```

## JavaScript Symbols
- `Symbol` is not a object type, but a primitive type, so that can be created without `new`
- Symbols can store strings and support comparison, but two symbols are not equal even if the strings passed in are the same
    ```js
    var leland = Symbol("leland");
    var leland1 = leland;
    console.log(leland == leland1); // true;
    var leland2 = Symbol("leland");
    console.log(leland == leland2); // false;
    ```
