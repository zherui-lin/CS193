## Rules to Improve Website Performance
- *High Performance Web Sites* by Steve Souders includes 20 rules to improve website performace, rule 1 the most important, rule 10 the lease
- Focusing on frontend can essentially improve performance
- Frontend is everything showing up on the browser, including HTML, CSS, JS script and overall web design, backend is everything running on the server, including server-side programming, backend languages, databases, configurations, architectures, etc
- Cutting backend performance in half will make 5-10% improvement, while cutting cutting frontend performance in half will make 10-50% improvement
- Fixing frontend is relatively easy (hours or days of work), while fixing backend is hard (weeks to months)
- Rule 1: make fewer HTTP requests
    - 10-20% of reponse time is downloading HTML files
    - 80-90% of time is waiting for other files to download
    - e.g., CSS sprites, base64, image `<map>` to reduce downloads
- Rule 5: put stylesheets at the top
    - some browsers might not render elems until they get the stylesheet files
    - better to get the stylesheet immediately as soon as it is available
- Rule 6: put JavaScript at the bottom
    - scripts might modify the original HTML as soon as codes get executed
    - putting scripts at the bottom prevent HTML to wait for downloads of scripts
    - `<sciprt>` can be specified as `defer`, in which case the script can be put on the top
    - can also be specified as `async`, in which case the script will be also executed after the HTML is ready
- Rule 3: add an expires header
    - set expires attribute as a future date in the header of HTTP requests can cache the responses
    - set exteranl files in cache, in which case users do not need to download external files everytime
    - better to put expires date for all files except the main HTML file, which can support updates from developers
    - HTML should not be cached, since it can be updated frequently and the modifications do matter for users
- Rule 8: make JavaScript and CSS external
    - components naively in the main HTML file will be downloaded everytime
    - making files external prevent users from downloading external files everytime
- Rule 4: compress files
    - compress HTML, CSS and JS for more efficient downloads
    - but do not compress images and videos, since they have been compressed
- Rule 10: minify JavaScript
    - reduce whitespace and comments in JavaScript files, which can reduce the file sizes, for faster downloads
- Rule 2: use a content delivery network (CDN)
    - CDN creates duplicates of files in different places around the world
    - put images, CSS files, etc in CDN, which are suitable for distributed database system
    - e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare
    - but it is hard to test, since tests should be done in difference places with long distances
- Rule 11: avoid redirection
    - redirections make websites significantly slow

## Website Design
- Branding is important, if a website has some unique identities, users will be impressed in it and remember it
- Some common features are logo, font, color, and layout
- Logo is a good feature, better to copy it to each page
- Fonts can be serif or san-serif
    - serif is considered formal and authoritative, while san-serif is considered modern contemporary upbeat
    - examples of serif: new york times, washington post (a little bit mixed)
    - examples of san-serif: apple, IBM (except logo)
- Fonts can have fixed width (monofont) or variable widths
    - most fonts are variable-widthed
    - monofonts are usually used in codes or something highly related to computers (like in VSCode)
- Colors can be specified as RGB, CYMK (Cyan Magenta Yellow key/Black) or HSB (hue-saturation-brightness)
    - RGB colors are generated by adding colors, which applied for screens
    - CYMK colors are generated by subtracting colors, which is applied for printing or painting
    - HSB is another way that can be efficiently processed by computers, works in context of designs
    - hue supports all colors on the color spectrum
    - HSB can easily create color schemes like mono-color schemes, complementary-color schemes, split-comlementary-color schemes, analogous-color schemes
- Navigation within the website across pages is also important
    - do not only focus on the design of the main page
    - navigations from different pages back to the main page should be fully considered
- Other considerations: who is visitors? what is the technique purposes of the website? under what conditions will the visitors visit the website? etc
